Separation Energies:
		Across the board we see interesting effects in the separation energies as the
	neutron	counts vary from even to odd, and as they cross magic numbers. 
		We see that pairing effects produce marked differences from even to odd neutron
	counts, that is an increase in single neutron separation energy for (Pauli) paired 
	neutrons in even counts and a descrease for the unpaired neutron in an odd count. 
		Additionally, we see magic number effects in the neutron counts. That is as we
	pass magic number (full shell) neutron counts we see a marked descrease in separation
	energies as we begin to populate the next shell. The specific neutron magic numbers we 
	observe on each graph are given below.
	
		Oxygen: 8
		Fluorine: 8
		Calcium: 20, 28
		Nickel: 82
		Tin: 82
		Lead: 126

Liquid Drop Binding Energy:
		In our liquid drop binding energy plot, we see a reproduction of Alex Brown's 
	figures. The volume term is constant across our plot due to the graphs per nucleon nature,
	while the surface area term descreases in importance as A climbs. Though in our plot it is
	unclear (plot to be revised with a better software), in Brown's plot the coulomb term is
	quite jagged, creating a saw-tooth pattern similar to that seen on the separation energy
	plots. Lastly, the full term compares well with the observed data once the nucleus is of
	sufficient size, or the nucleon count is sufficiently high. This seems to make good sense
	given that a small nucleon count may be better thought of individual particles than one
	large mass.

Dripline: 
		We see that the prediction for the dripline differs from the fluorine data in that
	data shows the dripline at n=22 (H. Sakurai et al., Phys. Lett. B 448, 180 (1999)), but
	the liquid drop model fails in its prediction of n=18.
