Separation Energies:
		Across the board we see interesting effects in the separation energies as the
	neutron	counts vary from even to odd, and as they cross magic numbers. 
		We see that pairing effects produce marked differences from even to odd neutron
	counts, that is an increase in single neutron separation energy for (Pauli) paired 
	neutrons in even counts and a descrease for the unpaired neutron in an odd count. 
		Additionally, we see magic number effects in the neutron counts. That is as we
	pass magic number (full shell) neutron counts we see a marked descrease in separation
	energies. The specific neutron magic numbers are given below.
	
		Oxygen: 8
		Fluorine: 8
		Calcium: 20, 28
		Nickel: 82
		Tin: 82
		Lead: 126

Liquid Drop Binding Energy:
		

Dripline: 
		We see that the prediction for the dripline differs from the fluorine data in that
	data shows the dripline at 22 but the liquid drop model predicts 18.
