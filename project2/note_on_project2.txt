A brief note on project2.cpp/project2.x:

This program is currently in development, but I will refrain from updating the file currently listed here until such a time as it has been reviewed. Currently it can handle all requirements for the project with some additional features. Currently it outputs to screen

	the predicted number of states (nchoosem)
	the actual number of states (should match nchoosem)

	TO BE REMOVED:	list of zprojections due to fix some sort of memory leak or issue with the code	

	list of states plus 	zprojection		pair_test	zproj=0&&pair_test==true

	count of states which have zproj==0&&pair_test==true 		list of said states

	hamiltonian as created by program

	original position of energy in diagonalized matrix
	energies in order of E_0 ... E_(n-1)
	state vector for each energy as column vector


The list of zprojections will be removed, but it seems to solve the issue of the zproj&&pair_test function not working. Once I find the error in the code I will remove it. 

If you wish to remove the matrix output, comment out the print states for the state vectors. I have kept all of the above largely as diagonstic tools, but each is useful to check for consistency at this simple stage.
