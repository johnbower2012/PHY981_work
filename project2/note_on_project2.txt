A brief note on project2.cpp/project2.x:

If a general construction of states is desired, simply input: 
	p = number of levels	omega = degeneracy		m = #particles		level_spacing	g		_placeholder_ _placeholder_ (Here the hamiltonian is erroneous)
	

If a pair construction is desired, the hamiltonians becomes useful and the pair_test may be useless, input as before except:
	p = number of levels	omega = degeneracy		m = #particles	level_spacing	g	hamil. file outputname		hamil. to_be_diagonalized name (currently simply use the same as output)


This program is currently in development, but I will refrain from updating the file currently listed here until such a time as it has been reviewed. Currently it can handle all requirements for the project with some additional features. Currently it outputs to screen

	# of states

	list of states plus 	zprojection		pair_test	zproj=0&&pair_test==true

	count of states which have zproj==0&&pair_test==true 		list of said states

	hamiltonian as created by program

	original position of energy in diagonalized matrix
	energies in order of E_0 ... E_(n-1)

	state vector for each energy as column vector


If you wish to remove the matrix output, comment out the print states for the state vectors. I have kept all of the above largely as diagonstic tools, but each is useful to check for consistency at this simple stage.
